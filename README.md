github lessons
Hello,
My name is Simel,I am a website developer.I use HTML,CSS and JavaScript.
Github is my best version control place and it keeps my code.
I am refreshing my skills in here...

git clone
git add
git confif user.name
git config user.email

Working with Git on the terminal is so fun...
